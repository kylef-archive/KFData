/**
 KFDataStore is a wrapper around an NSPersistentStoreCoordinator. You would
 normally create a single instance of KFDataStore to use across the whole
 of your application. Then you would run
 managedObjectContextWithConcurrencyType: to get hold of a managed object
 context. Alternatively you can use performWriteBlock: and performReadBlock:
 to run a block.
